Completed Bells and Whistles:
1) Bell: Tooltips
Completed using a simple div and transitions
2) Bell: Xs and Ys
Completed both Xs and Ys with coordinated views.
Created a class for each bar to identify and select when its corresponding x or y point is selected
3) Bell: Styling your Visualization
Used a old parchment paper image to cover the SVGs
4) Bell: Best Fit Lines
Used least squares to find the best fit. The best fit line equation is then overlaid on the SVGs
(part 3 SVGs instead of part 5 svg).
5) Whistle: Transitions
Completed by using a select menu. The select menu onchange will change the dataset with transitions
6) Whistle: Replication
Created similar visualizations using Tableau. The bar chart was particularly hard to create. Tableau
did not provide a way to maintain row numbers or indices. The multiple scatter plot was created using
a dashboard on Tableau.
7) Whistle: Coordinated Views
Created using class ids.
